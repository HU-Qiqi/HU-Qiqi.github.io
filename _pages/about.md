# üè´ About me
Hi, I am Qiqi Hu (ËÉ°ÈΩêÈΩê), a master student at Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Thermal Management Engineering and Materials in Shenzhen Intrnational Graduate School, Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Hongda Du](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/dhd/list.htm). I also used to be a visiting student in Southern University of Science and Technology, advised by [Prof. Feng Zheng](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=fengzheng&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=1&lang=en).  Before that, I got my undergraduate degree from Qingdao University of School of Computer Science and Technology, and fortunately supervised by [Prof. Hanlin Zhang](https://cst.qdu.edu.cn/info/1072/7423.htm).

My research interests mainly include **trustworthy diffusion models and content security in AIGC**.

Please feel free to [email me](mailto:chelseyhu111@gmail.com) for research, collaborations, or a casual chat.
